  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Namazu's Fault</strong> is a puzzle game developed during the
      <em>Scientific Game Jam Tokyo 2025</em>, where it received both the
      <strong>Golden Pixel Award</strong> and the <strong>Best Gameplay Award</strong>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The project was created by a multidisciplinary team under tight time constraints.
      My main contributions focused on gameplay programming, system architecture, and
      technical implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on core mechanics, interaction logic, and overall game flow, ensuring that the gameplay 
      systems and design balance were tightly integrated into a cohesive experience.
